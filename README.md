# ChitChat

ChitChat is a chat application in which you can have real-time communication with other users and have room chat as well.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

All you need is to have node and npm installed on your local machine

### Installing

First clone the repo into your local machine

next you need to open the folder in either your IDE or in Termina/CMD

and run 

'''
npm install.
'''

Second you will be having two main folders Front-End and Back-End

open each folder in your IDE or Terminal/CMD and run:

'''
npm install
'''

After running npm install in the ChitChat folder, Front-End folder and Back-End folder you should be all set. 



### Running the App

You can run the application in two ways:

### Methode 1

 - Open ChitChat folder in your IDE or Termina/CMD.
 - Run **npm start** in CLI

the application should start and you will be all set to use it.

### Methode 2: 

You can run client-side and server-side separately: 
 - Open each folder (Front-End and Back-End) in the IDE or Terminal/CMD (each folder on it's own)
 - Run **npm start** in each CLI
Now each Folder will run on it's own
